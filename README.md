# My Little Pony: PureScript Is Magic

A simple example of how to build a game using
[PureScript](http://purescript.org/) and
[purescript-signal](https://github.com/bodil/purescript-signal).

## Usage

Assuming you have [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and
[PureScript](http://purescript.org/) already installed:

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm start
```

The game will now be running on <http://localhost:1337/>.
